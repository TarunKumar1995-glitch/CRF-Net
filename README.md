# CRF-Net

This repository contains a modified version of the original code made publicly available (https://github.com/TUMFTM/CameraRadarFusionNet) by Felix Nobis et al. for their work on "A Deep Learning-based Radar and Camera Sensor Fusion Architecture for Object Detection".

With this version of the code, the scripts can be used with TF 2.4.1, Cuda 11.0 (tested on Ubuntu 20.04). More details on setting up the dependencies along with our reproducibility attempt can be found here - https://baratam-tarunkumar.medium.com/evaluation-of-camera-radar-fusion-net-crf-net-6821f2a75145

Note: ReadMe for configuration file is updated to guide the usage of partial datasets.
